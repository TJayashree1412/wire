        <p>Focus on security and privacy has been important for Wire from day one. Over the years we've
            taken numerous steps to strengthen our technology and sharpen
            our privacy-by-design approach to our product and business model.<br><br>

            This is more relevant than ever with many starting to realize the destructive
            effects of weak security and lack of privacy on both day-to-day business operations,
            and our lives as people who trust our most intimate details to various online services.</p>

        <h3>2014</h3>
        Wire was launched on December 3, 2014.
        <ul>
            <li>End-to-end encrypted voice calls for 1:1 and groups</li>
            <li>One of the first to offer E2EE group calls</li>
            <li>TLS for messaging and file sharing</li>
            <li>Account registration with email (no phone number required)</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <h3>2016</h3>
        <h3>March</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Launched end-to-end encryption for all communication - chats, calls, shared files. All future
                functionality will make full use of this.</li>
            <li>Open sourced Proteus encryption protocol, an independent implementation of Axolotl double ratchet
                protocol in Rust programming language.</li>
            <li>Published a security white paper as well as a privacy white paper. Over two and a half years later,
                at the time of posting this Wire is still one of the very few secure messaging and collaboration
                solutions to offer that level of detail about its privacy practices.</li>
            <li>Published transparency report that is updated annually</li>
            <li>All security related resources available at wire.com/security
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h3>July</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fully open sourced the app code on all platforms – iOS, Android, desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
                and web. Wire’s users can now build their own client from our source code and run it on our
                platform.</li>
            <li>First unofficial meeting of what will become Messaging Layer Security working group under IETF in
                2018. Wire is one of the founding member together with University of Oxford, INRIA, Cisco, Mozilla,
                Facebook, Google, Twitter and others.</li>


        </ul>

        <h3>August</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>New feature: Delete messages from all devices – this gives people better control over messages that
                have been accidentally posted into wrong conversations, for example.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>October</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>New feature: Timed messages disappear when the timer runs out. Useful for keeping conversation
                history tidy and adding an extra layer of security for sharing sensitive data like credit card
                details or login details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>December</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Introduction of @usernames to make it easier to find others without having to share a phone number
                or email address. It's no longer possible to search for other users by email address, and email
                address associated with accounts are no longer visible to others.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p></p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>2017</h3>
        <h3>January</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Shorter, clearer Privacy Policy – written for everyone, not just the lawyers.</li>
            <li>72 hour maximum log retention period – No other communication platform has such a short, specific and
                publicly announced log retention policy.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>February</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Independent security audit: Protocol implementation, no critical issues discovered and all found issues
                fixed by the time the audit was published.</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>March</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Call security upgrade - added end-to-end encryption verification to make man-in-the-middle protocols
                impossible, and removed any call log sharing with Wire servers</li>
            <li>Constant bit rate encoding added as an option for calling. Wire is the first of the secure messengers
                to implement this option with WebRTC/Opus. We contributed code back to WebRTC so that other solutions
                that use WebRTC can also benefit.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>April</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Announcing the start of open sourcing the server code. First code repositories published on Github.</li>
            <li>Implemented end-to-end encryption for iOS share extension to strengthen on-device security when sharing
                content from other apps into Wire conversations.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>June</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>"What are your thoughts on Wire?" This is a question people have asked Edward Snowden daily for a long
                time now. He finally replies:</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>September</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Wire server code is 100% open source</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>November</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Entry to the business market: Launched Wire Pro – the most secure collaboration platform for businesses
                and other organizations that adds business features like team admin, access control and more in
                addition to the existing functionality.

            </li>
            <li>Public beta program for Android and iOS announced</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                New feature: End-to-end encryption extended to conversations with non-Wire users via guest rooms. Wire
                users can invite others to join simply by sharing a web link. Other party does not need to download and
                install the app or even create an account.
            </li>
            <li>New feature: History backups have come to Wire. This lets you take all the conversations, sent images,

                messages feature we added in October, 2017.</li>
            <li>Highlighted the future threat of quantum computing on today's encryption protocols and shared the code
                of proof-of-concept post-quantum Proteus protocol.</li>
